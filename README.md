# Torchrunner
>A PyTorch wrapper for training deep learning models .

This library provides similar deep neural network training functionality to that found in libraries such as [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/), but is not nearly so ambitious in its scope.  The intent was to borrow some of the useful patterns found in these other libraries (e.g., training loop customization using callbacks) and create a simpler framework that is easier to customize and modify for my own research projects.

## Installation

To install the package on Windows or Linux, clone the repository and run the setup script from the repository root directory:

```sh
pip install -e .
```
